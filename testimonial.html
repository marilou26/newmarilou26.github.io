Empowering Community ALS implementers through Digital Citizenship which is essential to the topic of Alternative Learning System.</p>

I learned and was given a deep understanding about essential components of Computer, creating Microsoft Excel, Powerpoint Presentation wherein I have learned different shorcuts, inputing elements and creating different styles and also creating simple Web Page.</p>
